# Part 2: Scan the Container Image

Next, weâ€™ll have GitHub actions run a container image scan. Weâ€™ll be using Docker Scout for our image scanning. Recall in Assignment 3 that we investigated our container layersâ€™ vulnerabilities with Docker Scout in the Docker Desktop UI. Weâ€™ll use similar functionality in GHA but have the scans run as part of our `CI/CD` pipeline. Weâ€™ll export the results and investigate the findings. 

# Step 1: Update the CI Workflow

Weâ€™ll update our `main.yml`  file to include another job for container image scanning using Docker Scout. Note that this is a new *job*, so we need to start our definition at the same indentation level as our SAST scan job. Leave your existing code as is, and add a new job called `image_scan` thatâ€™s aligned with `sast_scan` . This job will also run on `ubuntu-latest`. 

```yaml
name: build
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
jobs:
  sast_scan:
    name: Run SAST Scan
    ...... 
    image_scan:
       name: Build Image and Run Image Scan
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
```

Next, we need to checkout our code, set up Docker, and then build the image from our Dockerfile. Add the code snippet in blue to your `image-scan` job: 

```yaml
name: build
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
jobs:
  sast_scan:
    name: Run SAST Scan 
#...    
  image_scan:
       name: Build Image and Run Image Scan
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest

       steps:
       - name: Checkout code
         uses: actions/checkout@v4
    
       - name: Set up Docker
         uses: docker-practice/actions-setup-docker@v1
         with:
          docker_version: '20.10.7'
    
       - name: Build Docker Image
         run: docker build -f Dockerfile -t pygoat_app:latest .
```

# Step 2: Use GHA Secrets

Next, use GHA secrets to authenticate to your DockerHub registry. Add the following to your `main.yml` file:

```yaml
name: build
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
jobs:
  sast_scan:
    name: Run SAST Scan
    ...... 
    image_scan:
       name: Build Image and Run Image Scan
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest

       steps:
       - name: Checkout code
         uses: actions/checkout@v4
    
       - name: Set up Docker
         uses: docker-practice/actions-setup-docker@v1
         with:
          docker_version: '20.10.7'
    
       - name: Build Docker Image
         run: docker build -f Dockerfile -t pygoat_app:latest .
        
       - name: Docker Scout Scan
         uses: docker/scout-action@v1.15.0
         with:
           dockerhub-user: ${{ secrets.REPO_USER }}
           dockerhub-password: ${{ secrets.REPO_PWD }}
           command: quickview,cves
           only-severities: critical,high
           sarif-file: scout-report.sarif
```

- To use Docker Scout functionality, we need to authenticate to Docker Hub. To do that, we need to pass two variables to our repository:
    - `secrets.REPO_USER`
        - This will be your Docker Hub username
    - `secrets.REPO_PWD`
        - This is your Docker Hub Personal Access Token (PAT) or password. PATs are beneficial because they can be scoped to a particular image, and allow for permissions scoping!
        - In Docker Hub, create a new PAT for Assignment 8!
- You can add these by following the instructions in [Assignment-7, Part 3: Configure CI/CD using GitHub Actions](https://github.com/MIS547-Fall-2024/Assignment-7/tree/main/Part_3_configure_ci_cd_using_gha) **Step 1: Add Secrets in GitHub**
    - The variables are named different things- this is because the action we used in Assignment 7 used a different docker action (i.e. `docker/login-action@v3` instead of `docker/scout-action@v1.15.0` )
    - Note the variable names (**secrets.REPO_USER** and **secrets.REPO_USER**). What does that tell you about where you need to save your username and PAT?
    
    <aside>
    
    ðŸ’¡Itâ€™s common for there to be multiple ways to piece together configurations from different templates. Youâ€™ve probably discovered this through your Docker image experimentation! Finding the best approach for your environment is done partly through experimentation, partly through understanding your environmentâ€™s unique requirements, partly through identifying contributors that you trust, and partly due to experience and preference. Just because you saw something done one way in one assignment doesnâ€™t mean itâ€™s the only way to achieve your goal. 
    
    </aside>
    

Lastly, weâ€™ll use `actions/upload-artifact@v3` to save the results of our image scan to our pipelineâ€™s artifacts.

```yaml
name: build
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
jobs:
  sast_scan:
    name: Run SAST Scan
    ...... 
    image_scan:
       name: Build Image and Run Image Scan
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest

       steps:
       - name: Checkout code
         uses: actions/checkout@v4
    
       - name: Set up Docker
         uses: docker-practice/actions-setup-docker@v1
         with:
          docker_version: '20.10.7'
    
       - name: Build Docker Image
         run: docker build -f Dockerfile -t pygoat_app:latest .
        
       - name: Docker Scout Scan
         uses: docker/scout-action@v1.15.0
         with:
           dockerhub-user: ${{ secrets.REPO_USER }}
           dockerhub-password: ${{ secrets.REPO_PWD }}
           command: quickview,cves
           only-severities: critical,high
           sarif-file: scout-report.sarif
    
       - name: Upload Artifact
         uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
         if: always()
         with:
           name: docker-scout-findings
           path: scout-report.sarif
```

Commit your code to your main branch, then navigate to the **Actions** tab to review the pipeline workflow.

# Step 3: View and Export the Container Scanning Results

- Just like we saw with our repository scan, our container scan results will be available as an artifact in our GitHub Actions workflow.

- Youâ€™re now ready to move onto **Part 3.**
